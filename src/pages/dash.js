                    <p>
                        Dash is a hypertext media platform for composing, arranging, and connecting rich, interlinked documents. 
                        As a full-time summer intern in 2025 and year-round lead developer, I've worked on building tools in Dash that help people reflect, 
                        write, and connect scattered ideas in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below are three projects I've worked on so far:

                <h2>Writing Augmentation</h2>

                <p>
                   I developed a suite of intelligent writing tools in Dash that deliver real-time, 
                   context-aware suggestions through a dynamic sidebar and smart inline content menu. 
                   The system learns each user's writing style over time and adapts its feedback accordingly, 
                   offering customizable, relevant guidance to help users write faster and better.
                </p>

                <h3>Suggestions Interface</h3>

                <div className="scroll-container">

                    <img src="/images/Dash/text/text_settings.gif" alt="Suggestions Sidebar" className="feature-gif" />
                    <p>
                    <strong>Suggestions Sidebar</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Each text node now includes an integrated sidebar where users can define their writing goals—such as tone, style, or intended impact.
                    The system then generates targeted suggestions aligned with these goals, making writing assistance more personalized and relevant.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Targeted Suggestions</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Suggestions are specific, actionable, and visually anchored. Hovering over a suggestion highlights the corresponding portion of text,
                    helping users clearly see what the suggestion refers to and how to apply it.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Inline Suggestions</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Users receive brief, non-intrusive inline prompts when they pause during writing—offering guidance without breaking their flow.
                    These can also be triggered manually using the <code>//suggest</code> command.
                    </p>

                        <br /><br />
                        Users can enable an active writing assistant that continuously analyzes the text in real time.
                        <br /><br />
                        This mode acts like a thoughtful colleague looking over your shoulder, offering critiques as you type.
                        Each suggestion is grounded in a specific passage or sentence.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Suggestion Storage and Navigation</strong>
                        <br /><br />
                        Active suggestions are stored in a sidebar log, keeping the writing process uninterrupted while suggestions accumulate.
                        <br /><br />
                        In the text, small bubbles appear next to the specific passages each suggestion targets. Clicking a bubble scrolls directly to the corresponding suggestion in the sidebar, and vice versa.

                    <strong>Resolving Suggestions</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Users can resolve or reject each suggestion. This adaptive feedback 
                    loop helps the assistant learn the user's preferences, 
                    allowing it to improve over time.

                        <strong>Suggestions Chatbot</strong>
                        <br /><br />
                        Single-line suggestions may not resonate with users without further context.
                        To address this, users can open a chat with the writing assistant to ask follow-up questions about any suggestion.
                        <br /><br />
                        The chatbot can explain the reasoning behind each suggestion, offer examples,
                        and automatically fix the relevant text.

                    <br /><br />
                    Each time a user selects text, the adaptive context menu surfaces 
                    relevant actions and generates quick-edit buttons tailored to the

                    <br /><br />
                    Content based suggestions show up as lightbulb buttons in the menu. 
                    These focus on meaning-level edits—like consistency, clarity, and correctness. 
                    <br /><br />
                    For example, the menu may generate a “Normalize Citations” 
                    button if it finds inconsistent referencing styles.

                    <strong>Formatting Based Buttons</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Formatting suggestions appear as text-style icons, 
                    helping users apply smart structural or visual adjustments 
                    that match the intent of their writing.
                    <br /><br />
                    For instance, the menu might surface options like “Bold Deadlines” 
                    in an email, “Convert to Code Block” for code-like snippets, 
                    or “Format as Block Quote” for quoted text.

                    <strong>Customizing Action Buttons</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Users can create, edit, and delete custom buttons for any workflow they want quick access to.
                    Each custom button, when clicked, is implemented automatically with AI.
                    <br /><br />
                    Buttons can be tailored to specific tasks, like streamlining notes into a fixed format,
                    or more general, like adding transitions, reducing wordiness, or changing tone.

                    <p>
                    Journaling has always been a grounding practice for me,
                    offering a way to make sense of scattered thoughts. However, 
                    existing journaling apps felt too rigid, with pre-set prompts 
                    and lacking the broader context of my thinking: from pictures I took, 
                    to articles I wanted to reflect on. So, I built a dedicated journaling system 
                    within Dash, able to integrate with my workspace while also engaging with me more deeply.
                    </p>

                        Because journal entries live alongside other 
                        Dash nodes, they can be placed near and linked to related readings, notes, tasks, or reflections, making them 
                        part of a broader spatial workflow.

                        Instead of pulling from static templates, Dash uses GPT to generate prompts tailored to

                <p>
                    Staying organized is difficult when tasks live separately from the work they're tied to. 
                    Most existing tools (like Google Tasks) have an unintuitive UI, lack full calendar integration, 
                    and don't support contextual linking. So, I built Dash's task system to keep action items and 
                    their context in one connected space and fill the gaps in existing task management tools.

                        With Dash, you can link a task to the exact artifacts it references: whether an essay draft, a PDF, a lecture
                        video, a notes doc, or a slideshow. Opening tasks directly in context of other documents streamlines your workflow,
                        allowing you to focus on tasks without losing sight of their background.
